Power Query Data Transformation Documentation

Introduction

Power Query serves as a powerful tool within Power BI, enabling users to transform and shape their data before it is loaded into the visualization environment. This documentation outlines the step-by-step process of transforming a dataset named "Apocalypse Food Prep" to enhance its usability for Power BI visualizations.

Initial Data Overview

The original data, presented in an Excel workbook, included a pivot table and a purchase overview. The pivot table had subtotals and grand totals, typical of Excel data.

Steps to Transform Data

1. Import Data into Power BI

- Utilize the "Import Data" feature to bring in the Excel workbook.
- Choose to transform the data rather than loading it immediately.

2. Explore Data in Power Query Editor

- Analyze the data structure in the Power Query Editor.
- Observe applied steps and available functionalities in the ribbon.

3. Remove Unnecessary Rows

- Eliminate top rows with null values using the "Remove Top Rows" option.

4. Promote Headers

- Utilize the "Use First Row as Headers" function to designate the appropriate column headers.

5. Adjust Data Types

- Review and modify data types as needed.
- Convert decimal values to a fixed decimal number, particularly for monetary values.

6. Filter Rows

- Remove rows containing unwanted values such as subtotals and grand totals.
- Filter based on specific criteria, e.g., removing rows containing the term "Total."

7. Remove Unwanted Columns

- Delete unnecessary columns, such as the grand total column.

8. Transpose or Unpivot Columns

- Transpose data to make it more conducive to Power BI visualizations.
- Use the "Unpivot Columns" feature to convert column-wise dates into rows.

9. Data Cleanup and Renaming

- Rename columns to make them more intuitive.
- Adjust column headers and labels for clarity.

10. Validate and Finalize

- Review the transformed data to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- Verify that data types and column names align with the desired outcome.

11. Close and Apply

- Confirm the transformation by clicking on "Close & Apply."
- The data is now ready for visualization in Power BI.

Conclusion:

The Power Query transformation process has significantly improved the usability of the original dataset for Power BI visualizations. 
The cleaned and structured data allows for more meaningful insights and efficient creation of dashboards. 
This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for replicating the data transformation process.
