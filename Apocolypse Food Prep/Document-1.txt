Power BI Project Documentation

Introduction:
This documentation outlines the process of creating a Power BI project focused on analyzing expenses related to apocalypse food preparation. 
The dataset used in this project is derived from an Excel workbook named "Apocalypse Food Prep."

Data Connection
1. Connect to Excel Workbook:
   - Open Power BI.
   - Choose "Excel Workbook" as the data source.
   - Navigate to the "Apocalypse Food Prep" file in the Power BI Tutorials folder.
   - Click "Connect."

2. Data Preview:
   - Access the Navigator to preview the available sheets.
   - Select "Apocalypse Food Prep" for analysis.

3. Power Query:
   - Transfer to Power Query for data transformation.
   - Renamed the "Date" column to "Date Purchased."
   - Filtered out irrelevant data (e.g., "Milk" for apocalypse preparation).
   - Applied steps are documented in the "Applied Steps" panel.

4. Data Loading:
   - Load the transformed data into Power BI Desktop.

Power BI Interface Overview
1. Data Tab:
   - Accessed the "Data" tab to review loaded data.
   - Examined columns and made quick observations about the dataset.

2. Model Tab:
   - The "Model" tab, is useful for managing relationships between multiple tables (not applicable in this case).

3. Report Tab:
   - Navigated to the "Report" tab for visualization creation.

Initial Data Analysis
1. Data Exploration:
   - Investigated the dataset for purchasing patterns over months.
   - Analyzed the products and stores involved in the apocalypse food preparation.

2. First Visualization: Best Store or Product
   - Created a stacked column chart to compare total spending at different stores.
   - Identified Costco as the most cost-effective option.
   - Noticed variations in prices for specific products at different stores.

3. Second Visualization: Total by Store:
   - Developed a clustered column chart to compare product-wise spending across stores.
   - Noted differences in prices for various products at different stores.

4. Formatting:
   - Adjusted the visuals for better presentation.
   - Added relevant titles to each visualization.
   - Included data labels for clarity.

Documentation Conclusion:
In a short timeframe, the project transitioned from data connection to insightful visualizations. 
Initial findings suggest Costco as the preferred store for apocalypse food preparation, with exceptions for certain products available at other stores at a lower cost. 
Subsequent videos in the series will delve deeper into specific Power BI functionalities, providing a comprehensive understanding for creating sophisticated dashboards.
